*Android Example*

**Running the App**
1. Run the SpringTest project
2. In `MainActivity` on line 25 set `IP_ADDRESS` to your IP Address (IPv4) 
1. Run the App using Android Studio.
2. On the Home Page you will see some data that comes back from the SpringTest API
3. When you click on the hamburger menu you see two options `Home` and `Personalization`
4. When you click on `Personalization` you will be taken to a new page that says "Hello Personalization" and also has a left side menu
5. There you will have the option to get the greeting for an individual user, modify data for a user, or add a new user.
6. There is some error handling on this page, but it is definitely possible to crash the app, by putting in incompatible data.
